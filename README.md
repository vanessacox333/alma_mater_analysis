## Modeling earnings with linear regression

### Goal: Model the earnings based on the variables included in the data set.

#### Specific questions:

-Perform a two sample test to compare the earnings of individuals who attend private vs public institutions. <br />
-Explain how you chose the statistical test to compare the two populations of private cs public institutions.
-Perform a power analysis of the statistical method you used to compare the two populations, and explain how you chose the parameters in your power analysis.
-Remove the variables school and place, and generate a new variable which is the state the school is located in. Explain why it makes sense to remove the variable school.
-Explain why a regression is more powerful than simply comparing two populations.
-Start by exploring the data with exploratory graphs, and consider transformations to make relationships linear. Explain your reasoning in exploring transformations, and also explore relationships between both numerical and non-numerical data.
-Discuss at least two different model building methods for regression.
-Explain the meaning of two way interaction terms.
-Explain why you did or did not include transformed variables.
-Begin by building your best model to predict earnings, but without the variables school, place, or public. Use two different methods to produce your model(s). What are your model(s), and explain the meaning of each model
-How many different models (without interaction and transformation) can be produced?
-What is the probability at least one variable not important for regression has been included in the model? Feel free to make any simplifying assumptions.
-Select a final model and assess the model assumptions.
-Add the variable public to your final regression model. Assess the impact and importance of the variable to the regression model.
-Explain the logic of adding the variable public to the regression model as the last step.

#### Specified Research Question:
How are earnings affected by alma mater? 

#### Background 
Our analysis will determine which variables most influenced a studentâ€™s future earnings. The data set obtained from DASL provides information from 706 private and public institutions. In addition to school name and location, standardized test scores (ACT and SAT), price, price with aid, percent need, merit aided and category of school were included.
